# ECG-Signal-to-time-series
image processing test to mimic an ECG signal smoothing and studying unstructured data  


This project extracts ECG-like signals from ECG images using Python, OpenCV, and signal processing techniques. It includes interpolation and smoothing to convert raw pixel traces into smoother signals resembling physiological ECG.

## Features
- Convert ECG images to time-series signals
- Interpolation of extracted signals
- Smoothing using Savitzky-Golay filter
- Visualization of raw and smoothed signals
